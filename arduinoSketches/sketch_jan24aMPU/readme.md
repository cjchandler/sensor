#Here is arduino code that I've been working on. 

##jan 24: 
Here is a couple downloaded sketches, testing the openROV MPU chip. 
I2C scan just checks if there are I2C devices connected. 
The MPU is code that grabs raw data from the chip, sends it over serial on usb
to computer. not sure how to interpret it.

I installed rosserial_arduino.
